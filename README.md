# Nintendo RSS Reader

This is the original Nintendo RSS Reader by Se√±or Contento. It is not affiliated with Nintendo at all, it is just a homebrew RSS Reader which may also be ported to the Wii too (as the only RSS reader RSSMii does not work on my brother's wii and there is no RSS Reader for the 3ds at all). This is my first real homebrew app, so enjoy!

This RSS reader is designed to use SpotPass to notify readers of any news from the readers' RSS feeds. Upon launching the software (either via Home Menu Icon or via Notification Center) the readers then can read an already downloaded news article.

### Todo
* Support .MPO images (and download to Camera Application) (also other Media too)
* Use Spotpass (BOSS)
* Allow deleting System Notifications (for old RSS feeds, etc...)
* Allow option to import old RSS news (either at time of publishing or at user specified date (aka Now) for ordering in Notification Center)
